# Weather App

A simple weather React + TypeScript app that shows the weather for a given city using the [Open Weather](https://openweathermap.org/) API. 

## Setup:

1. Clone the repository with `git clone https://github.com/RaymoZou/weather-app.git`
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`
3. Create a `.env` file in the project directory root with the following field:
```
VITE_API_KEY={YOUR_SECRET_KEY_HERE} // OpenWeatherMap API key
```
4. Start development server with `npm run dev`:

## Features:

- Minimalistic UI created using the Material UI component library - one of the reasons for choosing this library is that it offers pre-built React components such as buttons and input fields which allow for rapid prototyping. 
- 5-day weather forecast
- Local browser storage utilization for efficient data fetching
